### Introduction

Agriculture, despite being a trade that has been consistent since a long time ago, is among the few industries that are at a large risk due to how easily uncontrollable factors can affect its main produce crops.
While some of these cannot be precisely avoided, other challenges such as fluctuating market prices, unpredictable weather patterns, and the need for sustainable prices can be addressed through the integration of technology in agriculture to,

      1. Enhance productivity
      2. Ensure Sustainability
      3. Support Farmers in decision-making.

### Research Problem

#### Core Issues
      Inconsistent market prices
      Weather unpredictability
      Inadequate Crop Growth Insights
      Limited Decision Support
      Maintaining sustainable farming practices

    These challenges leads to farmers being hindered in their ability to make informed decisions, ultimately leading to inefficiencies, reduced profitability, and increased risk in agricultural production![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cde8cee-760b-4224-83f5-72fcfa8fffbb)

### Proposed Solution

An AI-driven platform designed to support farmers by providing data-driven predictions and tailored recommendations. 

This system will assist farmers in predicting market trends, optimizing crop growth, and ensuring sustainable practices through,

    1. AgriProfitPredict - Comprehensive Price and Profit Prediction System
    2. AgriGrowth Analysis Predictor
    3. CropWise Decision Support System for Crop Recommendation
    4. Personalized Agri Assistant

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
